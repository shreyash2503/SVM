# SVM - Support Vector Machine

- This is a from scratch implementation of SVM algorithm in python.
- The Binary SVM is a soft margin SVM trained using gradient descent.
- The Multiclass SVM is a extension of the binary SVM using the one-vs-all approach.

- I am soon going to add the kernel trick to the SVM using Lagrangian Multipliers.
